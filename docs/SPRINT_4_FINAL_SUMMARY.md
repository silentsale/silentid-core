## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well:
1. **Parallel Agent Execution:** No blocking, smooth coordination
2. **API Contract Upfront:** Prevented frontend/backend mismatches
3. **Incremental Testing:** Agent D tested as features were delivered
4. **Regular Documentation:** All agents updated docs after each change
5. **Clean Code Structure:** Modular architecture made changes easy

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Earlier Integration Testing:** Some integration issues found late
2. **More E2E Tests:** Need more complete user journey tests
3. **Performance Profiling:** Could optimize query performance earlier

### Best Practices to Continue:
- Maintain 100% passwordless compliance (automated checks)
- Keep API contracts in sync via Agent A coordination
- Update documentation immediately after code changes
- Run security audits after each feature
- Maintain brand consistency (Royal Purple #5A3EB8)
