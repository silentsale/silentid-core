## 3. TrustScore

---

### 3.1 How TrustScore Works

**Slug:** `trustscore/how-it-works`
**Category:** TrustScore
**InfoPointKey:** `trustScoreOverall`
**Screen Path:** Home → TrustScore Card → Breakdown

**Info Point Summary:** Your TrustScore (0-1000) combines Identity, Evidence, and Behaviour to show your trustworthiness.

---

**Summary:** A complete guide to how TrustScore is calculated.

**When to use this:** Anyone wanting to understand their TrustScore.

#### What is TrustScore?

TrustScore is a number from 0 to 1000 that represents how trustworthy you appear to others online. Higher is better.

#### The Three Components

Your TrustScore is calculated from three components:

| Component | Max Points | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Identity | 250 | Who you are (verified identity) |
| Evidence | 400 | What you can prove (receipts, profiles) |
| Behaviour | 350 | How you act (account patterns, reports) |

**Total Maximum: 1000 points**

#### The Formula

```
TrustScore = Identity + Evidence + Behaviour
```

No complicated maths - your score is simply the sum of your three components.

#### Weekly Regeneration

Your TrustScore recalculates every week to reflect:
- New evidence you've added
- Changes in your behaviour patterns
- Updated information from connected profiles

#### FAQs

**Q: Can my score go down?**
A: Yes, if safety reports are filed against you or if suspicious activity is detected.

**Q: How quickly can I improve my score?**
A: Most users see significant improvement within 2-3 weeks of active use.

**Q: Do other users see my exact score?**
A: Only if you set your visibility to Public. You can also show just your tier.

### 3.2 Identity Component

---

**Summary:** Understanding the Identity component of your TrustScore.

**When to use this:** Users wanting to improve their Identity score.

#### Identity Component (250 points max)

The Identity component measures how well you've verified who you are.

#### How points are earned

| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Email verified | ~50 |
| Stripe Identity verification | ~150 |
| Passkey set up | ~25 |
| Phone verified (if applicable) | ~25 |

#### Stripe Identity Verification

This is the most valuable part of your Identity score. It confirms you're a real person with a government-issued ID.

**How it works:**
1. Tap "Verify Identity" in the app
2. You're directed to Stripe's secure verification
3. Take a photo of your ID and a selfie
4. Stripe confirms your identity
5. We receive confirmation (but never your documents)

**Important:** SilentID never sees or stores your ID documents. Stripe handles this securely.

#### FAQs

**Q: Why is identity verification so many points?**
A: It's the strongest proof that you're a real, verified person.

**Q: What if my verification fails?**
A: You can retry up to 3 times per 24 hours. Make sure your ID photo is clear.

**Q: Is my ID stored?**
A: No. Stripe stores your verification data. We only receive a yes/no confirmation.

- Keep your login patterns consistent
- Respond to any security alerts promptly

#### FAQs

A: Yes. Contact support to review any reports you believe are unfair.

- **Low/High Risk**: They may want to proceed carefully

#### Improving your label

Move up to the next tier by:
1. Completing identity verification (+200 points)

3. Maintaining good behaviour over time

#### FAQs

**Q: Can I hide my label?**
A: Yes, use "Private Mode" to hide both score and label.

**When to use this:** Users seeing "Linked" or "Verified" badges on their profiles.

#### Two States: Linked vs Verified

When you connect a profile, it can be in one of two states:

#### Linked

- **Badge**: Shows as "Linked" on your passport
- **Upgrade**: Can be upgraded to Verified anytime

#### Verified

- **What it means**: You proved you own this account

- **Points**: +15 TrustScore points (max 75 from verified profiles)
- **Badge**: Shows as "Verified" with a green checkmark

Verified profiles are worth 3x more points because they prove:

- Your connected identity is real

#### How to upgrade to Verified

1. Go to Profile → Connected Profiles
2. Find the profile you want to verify

### 8.4 TrustScore Not Updating

**Slug:** `troubleshooting/trustscore-not-updating`
**Category:** Troubleshooting & Common Issues
**Screen Path:** Home → TrustScore

**Info Point Summary:** TrustScore updates weekly. New evidence appears in your next recalculation.

---

**Summary:** Why your TrustScore might not reflect recent changes.

**When to use this:** Users expecting score changes that haven't appeared.

#### TrustScore Not Updating

If you've added evidence but don't see score changes, here's why.

#### Weekly recalculation

TrustScore recalculates every week, not instantly. This means:
- Evidence added today shows next week
- Profile verification may not reflect immediately
- Be patient - your score will update

#### Exceptions (faster updates)

Some changes trigger immediate recalculation:
- Completing identity verification
- Major evidence milestones

#### Check your breakdown

Even before recalculation, you can see pending items:
1. Go to Home → TrustScore → Breakdown
2. Look for "pending" items
3. These will count at next recalculation

#### Why my score went down

Scores can decrease due to:
- Safety reports from other users
- Evidence flagged for integrity issues
- Extended inactivity

Check your Security Center for any alerts.

#### Still stuck?

If your score hasn't updated after a week:
1. Check that evidence actually saved
2. Review your breakdown for errors
3. Contact support if something seems wrong

#### FAQs

**Q: When exactly does recalculation happen?**
A: Weekly on your account's anniversary day.

**Q: Can I force an update?**
A: Not manually, but major actions may trigger updates.

**Q: I verified my identity but score didn't change?**
A: Identity verification usually triggers immediate updates. Contact support if it didn't.
